       Get me oh.Get me oh oh.I see the light inside your eyes.You make me feel like.I'm awake.I don't know why you make me shine
       like a star in the sky.I'm ok.I wanna take a breathe.I'm falling in love.I'm falling in love.I wanna hold your hand.Don't leave me alone.Don't leave me alone.

      <b>Don't worry too much about what language you pick.</b> Many beginning coders struggle with what language to pick when they first start learning. The actual language that you start learning on doesn't make a big difference when it comes to learning about data structures and logic. These are the skills that matter most, and they can be honed with any language..</p>

      <p id="p3" class="no-img">
      When picking a language, just focus on what kind of development you want to start with and pick an introductory language from there. For example, if you want to learn web development, start with HTML5, supplemented with CSS, JavaScript, and PHP. If you want to want to do desktop applications, start with C++ or another basic programming language..</p>
